A Summer to Remember: Growth, Goals, and Good Times

This summer was definitely one for the books. I got to do a little bit of everything. Over the duration of the summer, I traveled, worked, planned for the future, and even grew my social media a bit.
One of the best parts was taking a trip to North Carolina with my girlfriend and my grandpa. It was honestly unforgettable. We had a great time exploring, spending quality time together, and just making memories. It was the kind of trip that sticks with you.
When I wasn’t traveling, I was working at a store called Bargain Hunters. It was a solid experience my first real job where I had to show up, deal with customers, and just learn how things run in a workplace. It taught me a lot about responsibility and how to handle myself in a work setting.
I also started looking into colleges, which felt like a big step. It’s kind of crazy to think about how close I am to that next stage of life, but it felt good to start planning and thinking about where I want to go and what I want to do.
Oh, and on a fun note—I’ve been growing my TikTok following too. It’s been cool to see people enjoying the content I put out. It started as just a fun thing, but now I’m starting to take it a bit more seriously and seeing where it could go.
All in all, this summer was a mix of fun, growth, and looking ahead. I’m glad I made the most of it.
This summer, ive had time to reflect on my decisions that I made last school year as well. For a long time i asked myself what I was doing and why I was performing actions that would only set me back from where I want to be in life, and this summer I finally began to take heed on what I was doing and I promised myself that this year was the time I made a change. I set goals for myself, saying that I will begin to push myself in better attendance, more classwork, and overall better decision making. So, we will see where this year will take me, and hopefully, I become the person that I want to be by the end of the school year.
